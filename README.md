# Synthetic-SMG-Dataset
## from "Synthesizing Real-Time Ultrasound Images of Muscle Based on Biomechanical Simulation and Conditional Diffusion Network"
Multi-task Synthetic SMG Dataset

File naming format: \{Initial pennation angle Î±\}\_\{Number of sparse fascicles S\}\_\{Initial subcutis thickness ST\}\_\{Step\}\_\{random seed of reconstruction\}

Our synthetic SMG dataset includes Ultrasound images, aponeruosis masks, fascicle masks, and true SMG features.

Ultrasound images, aponeruosis masks, fascicle masks will be available after publication of relevant paper.
